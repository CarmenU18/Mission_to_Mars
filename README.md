# Mission to Mars

### Overview

Perform web scraping of different web pages where information about Mars can be extracted.

- The scarping was achieved using an automated web browser with the help of BeautifulSoup, Splinter and Python packages.
- MongoDB database was used to store the unstructured data from the web scrape.
- A web application was created with Flask to display the web scrape data by retrieving the data stored in mongo DB.
- With the obtained data a custom HTML page was created to present the data.

The websites used were:

- Latest news: *[Red Planet science](https://redplanetscience.com)*.
- Images: *[Space images](https://spaceimages-mars.com)*.
- Table Mars vs Earth: *[Galaxy facts](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com)*.
